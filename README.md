## afpfs-ng-OSX GUI

This repository contains the GUI related files included in the .pkg installer at https://github.com/mabam/afpfs-ng-OSX/releases .

"Library" and "etc" contain GUI related files and folders at the locations the afpfs-ng-OSX .pkg installer writes them to the boot partition.

"source" contains the uncompiled scripts of two of those files (I used Platypus for compiling afpfs-ng-OSX.mount_cmd.command).

"source/post-installation script" contains the post-install script built into the .pkg installer.
